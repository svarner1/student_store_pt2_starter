STEP 3:

First we are going to create JWT utils

- âœ… Add a new package for JWTs by running npm install --save jsonwebtoken.
- Add a new environment variable to the .env (and .env.template) file called SECRET_KEY. 
    Insert a secret string there. Make sure to extract it and export it in the config.js file.
    
- Define a new file in the utils directory called tokens.js.
- Import the jwt package and the SECRET_KEY from config.
- Create a function called generateToken that accepts a data parameter and returns a signed 
    token using the jsonwebtoken package and the SECRET_KEY.
- Below that define a createUserJwt function that accepts a user and creates a payload with 
    that user's email and admin status. It should return the result of calling the generateToken 
    method on that payload.
- Finally, create a validateToken function that accepts a function and runs a try...catch block.
 Try to verify the token with the jsonwebtoken package and the SECRET_KEY. If anything goes wrong
 , return an empty object.
- Export all functions.
